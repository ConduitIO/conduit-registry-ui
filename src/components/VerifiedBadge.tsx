/**
 * Renders the result of `deriveVerified()` (src/lib/deriveVerified.ts) — this
 * component NEVER computes trust itself, it only displays a boolean its caller
 * already derived from the verified index payload.
 *
 * Label wording is deliberately narrow: `deriveVerified()` only confirms that
 * this version's entry in the verified index *references* a signature bundle and
 * an SLSA provenance bundle (plus isn't yanked/revoked) — nobody in this build
 * pipeline downloads the artifact or runs `cosign verify` against it (see
 * deriveVerified.ts's doc comment for the full two-layer trust argument and its
 * residual risk). The INDEX this entry comes from is itself cryptographically
 * verified at build time by the conduit CLI's verifier (cmd/registry-verify,
 * --require-root) — see SignatureNote.astro — but "Signature on file" says
 * exactly this-version-much and no more. Real cryptographic verification of the
 * actual bytes happens at install time (`conduit connectors install`), not
 * here — see SignatureNote.astro, which every page rendering this badge must
 * also render so that caveat is real, visible page text next to the badge, not
 * a tooltip (CLAUDE.md: "say what was actually verified").
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a red/failure badge for `verified={false}`: a connector
 * between registration and its first signed release looks different from one
 * that actively failed a check (yanked/revoked get their own loud components —
 * EffectiveStatusTag, RevocationBanner). A muted/neutral state here avoids
 * conflating "no signature reference yet" with "known bad."
